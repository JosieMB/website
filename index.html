<h2>About the Lab</h2>

<p>The Bryant Group is based at the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/bryant-group/">Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> where it investigates the microbial ecosystems of the human lung and their roles in respiratory health and chronic lung disease. Our research focuses on the bacteria, viruses and fungi that inhabit the airways, with an emphasis on how these communities vary across individuals, evolve over time and differ between regions of the lung.
<br/>
We combine metagenomics, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, metabolomics and computational analysis to study both microbial and host biology at a high resolution. Through close partnerships with clinicians, we analyse longitudinal sputum and lung tissue samples from people with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and COPD. A particular area of interest is the behaviour, evolution and persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic lung disease, where it remains a major driver of morbidity.
<br/>
We are extending these approaches to study Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections, with a particular focus on understanding the biology, diversity and treatment resistance of Mycobacterium abscessus.
<br/>
By integrating these datasets, we aim to define the microbial and host pathways associated with disease progression, clarify mechanisms of host-microbe interaction and identify targets that could support future diagnostic or therapeutic advances.
